I don't take any credit for this, this was done while testing the viability of ChatGTP's new gui agent vs Claude Code, I will posts the comparisons at a later date.
Done in 0-shot using an a very detailed prompt, the agent was able iterate against itself testing the GUI giving this impressive result. 

Perhaps I can see a scenario of using said agents for GUI targeted QA ðŸ¤”
